# Customer Churn Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA)
on a telecom customer churn dataset to uncover insights, patterns, and key indicators that may lead to customer attrition. 
The goal is to help stakeholders understand what factors influence churn and guide decisions to improve customer retention

# Key Steps in Analysis

# 1. Data Cleaning:-
Handled missing values
Converted categorical features
Checked data types and corrected them

# 2. Univariate Analysis:-
Distribution of churn vs non-churn
Frequency distribution of variables

# 3. Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis:-
Relationship between churn and tenure, monthly charges, contract type, etc.
Correlation heatmaps

# 4. Visual Insights:-
Bar plots, histograms, pie charts, violin plots, and more
Feature-wise churn rate comparisons

# Libraries Used

pandas:  for data manipulation

numpy – for numerical operations

matplotlib – for plotting graphs

seaborn – for statistical visualizations

# Outcomes

Built a foundation for churn prediction modeling.
Identified actionable insights for reducing customer churn.
Recommended focus areas for customer retention strategies.
